07.07.2016 - 5:30 h - 5:30 h
DONE
- wrote many test cases for AdtList
- corrected some methods in AdtList
- thought about other ways to write the tests
- read some pages in my book about tests and how I could
shorten them by using equivalence classes

PROBLEMS
- the tests are depending on each other. If insert doesn't work,
the rest won't do it, too
- writing the tests by hand is just annoying and costs to much time

PLANS
- lower the amount of dependencies inside the tests
- using equivalence classes for tests
- finishing AdtList
- planing the tests for the other container types
- writing the tests for the other container types
- planing the benchmark

FEELING
- quite good
- feels like i did some work

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

08.07.2016 - 1 h - 6:30 h
DONE
- wrote some tests for AdtList.equals. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to see
in case of all tests failed, if it's just because my equals doesn't work
correctly, since the most other tests are relying on equals
- edited some of the inspection settings

PROBLEMS
- for some reason if I try to put 10 elements in a list, the last seems to
be lost

PLANS

FEELING
- unmotivated

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

09.07.2016 - 1:30 h - 8:00 h
DONE
- fixed the bug of the lost last element. Actually that wasn't a problem
with insert, rather with toString. It swallowed the last element by kicking
out the zeros created by the length/capacity difference
- I mistakenly used assertTrue(...equals(...)) instead of assertEquals for
the concatenation tests. The problem with this is that it won't show me
the two different lists used for the equality tests
- the tests for AdtList are working now. I will now start to refactor the
tests for AdtArray
- I forgot to reimplement the growing of the array in AdtList. Now it works,
too
- added some comments for AdtArray interface. I've no idea, why I didn't do that
long before (laziness?)

PROBLEMS

PLANS
- experiment with the equivalence class tests

FEELING
- ok. I could've worked longer, but at least I fixed the bugs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
10.07.2016 - 1h - 9: 00 h
DONE


PROBLEMS
- tried the equivalence class testing stuff, but it's harder than expected,
especially if I want to do it in a more abstract way.

PLANS
- writing an abstract benchmark suite

FEELING
- not good. I am dealing with the problem that I can't pass something like a
link to a function and in my case, I can't even use a lambda to simulate that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
11.07.2016 - 3 h - 12 h
DONE
- tried to change the implementation of find in AdtListImpl, like it was mentioned
in the course sheets. Unfortunately it doesn't work correctly on lists with duplications.
- implemented tests (ok, I just switched the adtList to adtSingleConc call.
Thank you past self for using an interface) for a single concatenated list as well as the list itself

PROBLEMS
- some tests for the SC list fail, because of the lack of memory
- I got some very strange fail massages, like "AdtListSingleConc[1, 2] != AdtListSingleConc[1, 2]"
and I had to switch the toString method to get a useful massage
- there are definitely to many instanceof checks. I guess it would've been nicer, if I used an isEmpty
method in Entry or something similar

PLANS
- implement benchmark

FEELING
- nice. It was fun to implement it :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1 h
12.07.2016 - -
DONE
- implemented some tests for all sorts
- implemented insertion sort

PROBLEMS
- writing the same tests for multiple objects with the same interface is problematic.
I have to discover, how to do it more nicely with junit

PLANS
