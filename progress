07.07.2016 - 5:30 h - 5:30 h
DONE
- wrote many test cases for AdtList
- corrected some methods in AdtList
- thought about other ways to write the tests
- read some pages in my book about tests and how I could
shorten them by using equivalence classes

PROBLEMS
- the tests are depending on each other. If insert doesn't work,
the rest won't do it, too
- writing the tests by hand is just annoying and costs to much time

PLANS
- lower the amount of dependencies inside the tests
- using equivalence classes for tests
- finishing AdtList
- planing the tests for the other container types
- writing the tests for the other container types
- planing the benchmark

FEELING
- quite good
- feels like i did some work

08.07.2016 - 1 h - 6:30 h
DONE
- wrote some tests for AdtList.equals. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to see
in case of all tests failed, if it's just because my equals doesn't work
correctly, since the most other tests are relying on equals
- edited some of the inspection settings

PROBLEMS
- for some reason if I try to put 10 elements in a list, the last seems to
be lost

PLANS

FEELING
- unmotivated

09.07.2016 - - h
DONE
- fixed the bug of the lost last element. Actually that wasn't a problem
with insert, rather with toString. It swallowed the last element by kicking
out the zeros created by the length/capacity difference
- I mistakenly used assertTrue(...equals(...)) instead of assertEquals for
the concatenation tests. The problem with this is that it won't show me
the two different lists used for the equality tests
- the tests for AdtList are working now. I will now start to refactor the
tests for AdtArray
